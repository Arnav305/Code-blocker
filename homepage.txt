GIT is easu to use for any type of knowledge worker.
Function of SCM:

HOW GIT different from other VCS?? :-
other vsc store information as a list of file based changes, it like information as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time. These type of VCS is called Delta based vcs like cvs, subversion, Perforce, Bazaar.
* GIT saves data more like a series of snapshots in a mini file system every time you commit save the state of the project git take the picture of your all files look like at that momentand stores a refrence to that snapshot
* To be efficent if file is not changed it does not save the file again.
